            This demo should render a small 
            green box in the top, left corner 
            of the page. When you hover over 
            the container, the box transitions 
            to the right. Notice that it moves 
            at a constant, steady speed.

            This demo illustrates an element 
            moving across the screen by 
            absolutely positioning it and 
            transitioning the left property. 
            There are, however, performance 
            reasons to avoid transitioning 
            certain properties, including left. 
            Iâ€™ll cover these issues in the 
            following chapter, along with a 
            better alternative using transforms.
