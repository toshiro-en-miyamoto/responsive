            is the initial value for everything that loads on your page; 
            static items are in flow and scroll with the document.
            We only tend to use this value if we need to 
            reset the position property on an element.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>position: relative</code></dt>
        <dd>
            With any of the offset properties of 
            <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code>, 
            you can push the element around from its default position. 
            The item that has <code>position: relative</code> 
            on it establishes a new <strong>containing block</strong>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>position: absolute</code></dt>
        <dd>
            An absolutely positioned item is taken out of flow, 
            and can then be positioned from the edge of its containing block
        </dd>
        <dt><code>position: fixed</code></dt>
        <dd>
            enables items to assume a fixed place on screen as the document loads, 
            and then stay in that place instead of scrolling with the rest of the page.
            A common reason to use fixed positioning is to keep a menu on screen 
            when scrolling through a long document.
            Notice that the box is taken out of flow and so will overlap content.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>position: sticky</code></dt>
        <dd>
            acts as if it is static until the document scrolls to a certain point 
            &mdash; at which time it acts as if it is fixed.
